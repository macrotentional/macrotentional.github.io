I'm a product designer in Madison, Wisconsin who's enthusiastic about creative problem-solving in a mobile-first ecosystem. I was born in Illinois, lived in Germany for a few years, and attended college in Iowa. 

When I’m not crafting user-centric design, I can be found jogging around town, exploring nature, checking out the latest concerts, or staying in and cooking up a storm.

Other career passions include marketing analytics, information architecture, and machine learning.

### Interested in working together?

I’m always down for solving a design challenge!
